This code creates a simple tomato clock that automatically switches to a rest period after each work period. The default work period is 25 minutes, the rest period is 5 minutes, and after every 3 work periods there will be a long rest period of 15 minutes. On the console, it will display the remaining time and make a sound when ending the clock. You can adjust and expand it to suit your needs.
